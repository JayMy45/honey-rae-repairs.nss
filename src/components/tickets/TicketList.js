}

if a staff member is logged in then "Emergency Only"/"Show All" buttons will display (with functions)...
else the "Create Ticket" button will appear for customers (if not a employee that signed in it must be a customer).

^whenever button is "Create Ticket" button is clicked the programs routes to /ticket/create (in ApplicationsViews) where the route is defined as TicketForm...there the form will be rendered.

How do websites handle guests...if not storing the data from users in the API...is there a short term memory options for GUESTs?
